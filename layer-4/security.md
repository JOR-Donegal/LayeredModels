# Security

We can keep a track of the applications which run across our networks based on port numbers, but this is very over simplistic, as malware can use a well-known port and be mistaken for a genuine application. Standard firewalls do this.

On a LAN, we can use protocols like IPSEC to secure file sharing, in my experience, this is rarely done.&#x20;

In the wide are, we use VPNs to secure sessions, based on IPSEC or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which these days is Transport Layer Security (TLS).
