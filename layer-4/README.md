# Layer 4

So now we have Layer 3, a way of communicating from a node on one network to any other node on any other network. The next thing we must worry about is the quality of that communication.&#x20;

How do I know if a packet of data I send is received?&#x20;

How do I tune my communications to the vagaries of the many links from end-to-end?&#x20;

These things we do at layer 4.
